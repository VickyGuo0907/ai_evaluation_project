So answer concisely: The Wright brothers.\\n\\nThe question perhaps expects knowledge of history. They ask \\\"first person\\\". Might be ambiguous. So should state that the first documented powered flight by a manned airplane was by the Wright brothers, but the first practical airplane was built by them, but earlier glider attempts existed by Otto Lilienthal. So answer: The Wright brothers.\\n\\nTherefore: The first person(s) to build a practical airplane were Orville and Wilbur Wright, in 1903. If they ask single person, answer Orville Wright as the inventor. Or Wilbur also. But both. So phrase: Orville and Wilbur Wright built the first practical airplane and first powered flight.
